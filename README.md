# Classical-CV-vs-Deep-Learning-Object-Detection
  This project implements a computer vision pipeline for real-time object detection and analysis from a live camera feed. It explores both classical (focused on circular object detection using color filtering, edge detection, and shape analysis) and deep learning-based (using a pre-trained YOLOv11 model for multi-class object detection) approaches.
